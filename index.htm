        <h1>Happy Birthday, Kowins!</h1>

        <p>
          Lately, Iâ€™ve been witnessing how God is shaping your character as a leader.
          Iâ€™m truly happy and grateful to be led by you. Thank you for being willing to
          grow and learn to become a good leader. Iâ€™ve seen your efforts, Ko, and I
          deeply appreciate them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Itâ€™s only been a little over a year since weâ€™ve known each other, yet youâ€™ve
          already taught me so many things â€” about forgiveness, about having standards,
          about grace, and even how to apologize sincerely. Through those moments, Iâ€™ve
          learned not to be afraid of doing great things.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first, I didnâ€™t even realize what my strengths were, but you helped me
          discover them. Thank you, Ko, for that. Thank you for choosing to be a leader
          whoâ€™s willing to set aside your ego for our growth. We are truly grateful for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          And personally, Ko, I just want to sayâ€¦ thank you â€” for leading with heart,
          for trying your best, and for being someone we can look up to.
        </p>

        <p>Happy birthday once again. Youâ€™re a blessing to all of us. ðŸŒ»</p>
